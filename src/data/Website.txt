The Lakehouse Restaurant Brand Story
 
The Lakehouse Restaurant offers a memorable menu with selections innovated by our founding owner/chefs. Our atmosphere is a balance of what we think of as functional minimalist industrial with pops of rustic elegant touches. This results in an open, welcoming space that seamlessly supports the tastes and comfort of our patrons while serving as a purposeful, efficient workspace for our employees. Our food options are reminiscent of fine dining without the conventional stiffness that can detract from the experience, and where possible, we source from area organic farmers and socially responsible enterprises.
 
We also make ourselves available for special events and catering. We can oversee as much of the process as needed—from arranging for entertainment, custom menu planning, and managing event coordination, to simply providing the best food for the occasion.
